'''
Given an array of n integers where n > 1, nums, return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Solve it without division and in O(n).

For example, given [1,2,3,4], return [24,12,8,6].

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (Note: The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)
